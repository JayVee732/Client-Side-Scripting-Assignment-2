# Client-Side-Scripting-Assignment-2

Details:	You	are	required	to	create	a	3	or	4	page	website	which	demonstrates	the	capabilities	of	JQuery	plugins	
(or	APIs)	which	should	be	demonstrated	using	jQuery	code	(JavaScript	can	be	included	as	required).	
You	should	also	research	and	use	a	JavaScript	task	runner	in	conjunction	with	your	assignment,	and	ideally,	
store	your	code	on	a	code	repository.		

The	pages	should	focus	on	design,	and	plugins/APIs	chosen	should	be	easy	to	demonstrate	to	the	class	(visual	feedback).			
It	is	a	requirement	that	you	use	a	website	template	(as	opposed	to	developing	the	site	from	scratch)	–
the	template	does	not	require	approval	from	myself.		

Your	choice	of	plugins/APIs	must	be	pre-approved	by	myself	(emails	only,	deadline	this	Friday	@	5PM)	and	in	general	
it	would	be	wise	to	pick	plugins/libraries	that	are	unrelated.	

For	example,	choosing	three	image	gallery	plugins	would	make	it	difficult	to	award	high	marks.		
You	are	required	to	work	in	groups	of	2	or	3	and	you	must	send	of	the	names	of	each	group,	
the	group	members	and	one	the	plugins/APIs	to	me	no	later	than	this	Friday,	at	17:00	via	email.	

Marks	will	be	allocated	as	follows:	- Use	of	plugins/APIs:	45%	- Presentation	and	ability	to	ask	and	answer	
questions:	10%	- Demonstration	of	a	JavaScript	task	runner:	10%	- Using	a	code	repository:	
10%	- Advanced	code/used	of	advanced	plugins/APIs,	use	of	other	advanced	concepts	not	covered	in	
detail	in	class	(AJAX/JSON	etc.):	25%	Up	to	30%	of	the	above	mark	may	be	lost	whereby	a	group	or	student	within	
a	group	fails	to	engage	with	myself	during	lab	classes	allocated	to	this	work.		

In	certain	circumstances,	I	will	allow	a	group	to	only	demonstrate	one	topic	if	it	is	of	a	sufficiently	advanced	nature.	
These	would	include	complex	APIs	such	as	highcharts,	or	the	demonstration	of	a	Framework	(e.g.	ReactJS)	as	opposed	to	plugins/APIs.			While	each	page	of	the	template	should	be	reasonably	well	designed	you	can	allocate	specific	pages	to	specific	tasks	(one	page	for	each	plugin)	or	mix	and	match.		
All	code	must	be	documented.	You	will	also	need	to	submit	everything	to	Turnitin.		
		
Deadlines:		Friday,	May 2nd	at	17:00.	Email	me	with	the	name	of	your	group,	student	names	and	one	plugin/API	
that	you	intend	to	use		

Friday,	March	31st	at	17:00.	Email	me	the	final	list	of	plugins/APIs	you	intend	to	use	(including	links	to	their	locations),	
along	with	the	name	of	the	JavaScript	task	runner	you	will	employ	as	well	
and	any	areas	you	believe	you	will	pick	up	extra	marks	(e.g.	‘We	will	be	using	JSON’,	‘Our	Plugin	A	is	very	complex’	etc.)

Friday,	April	28th.	Submission	of	all	work,	including	any	relevant	presentation	materials		

Wednesday,	May	3rd.	Presentation	to	class	with	Q&A	session		

What	your	result	in	this	assignment	indicates:	
90%	-	100%:	Impeccable	code,	concepts	introduced	which	are	beyond	those	expected	of	assignment,	
demonstration	of	concepts	I	am	currently	unaware	of.	Demonstration	of	critical	thinking	and	creativity.	
All	code	works.	600+	lines	of	code	(excluding	HTML	and	CSS)	

80%	-	90%:	Extremely	advanced	code	used, all	topics	covered	to	an	advanced	level. 
Demonstration	of	concepts	which	would	take	me	more	than	1	hour	to	fully	evaluate.	
500+	lines	of	code.	All	code	works.	70%	-	80%:	Outstanding	quality,	not	all	aspects	of	project	may	be	working
but	those	that	are,	are	applicable	to	the	requirements	above	with	code	of	high	quality.	
Vast	majority	of	code	works.	

60%	-	70%:	Overall	quality	of	work	very	good,	not	all	requirements	implemented	but	those	that	are	indicate	
solid	knowledge	of	problem	solving.	Ability	to	defend	work	done	and	
provide	explanations	or	non-working	code	samples	of	attempted	solutions.	

40%	-	60%:	Well-designed	project	which	succeeds	in	tackling	most	of	the	problems	in	the	assignment.
Able	to	provide	reasoning	for	areas	of	project	not	completed	and	evidence	of	genuine	effort	made
